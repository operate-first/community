## Brain dump:
* Send announcement/reminders on mailinglist/slack #announcements about upcoming meetings a few days ahead of said meeting
* Create a meeting structure which effectively syncs members about sub-project and working group updates
    * Each SIG adds their updates to the agenda pre-meeting
    * Each SIG shares what has been accomplished from their respective sub-project/workin-group from the time in between meetings

## Actions
* @humair PR for this min required processes
* Chairs: Finish and follow this new process by next SIG Community meeting
