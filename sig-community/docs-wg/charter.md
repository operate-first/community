# Documentation Working Group (Docs WG)
**Formerly _Contributor Experience Documentation Working Group (Contrib_X Docs WG)_**

This working group has expanded to encompass discussions around all areas of documentation, with the goal of exiting this working group into a Docs SIG.
At the same time, the Docs WG is completing the original mission of improving documentation for new users and contributors.

## Scope

**Improving documentation for new users and contributors**
This was the original mission of the _Contributor Experience Documentation Working Group (Contrib_X Docs WG)_.
This remains a primary goal of the working group, but does not need to be finished for a Docs SIG to form.
In such a case, a Docs SIG would take on the work being done by the WG and continue it as a WG or formalize it as a subproject.

**Planning and exiting to the Docs WIG**
Work output should be a plan to form the Docs SIG out of the working group.
Any documentation identified as needed but does not fit into the SIG creation or the new user/contributor experience scopes is left for the Docs SIG to discuss and decide.

## In scope

* Discussions around the interrelation of all documentation.
* Formation of the key "User and Contributor Handbook".
* Strategy and plans to form a Docs SIG.
* Promotion of documentation creation and improvement across the project.
* Resolving the gaps in documentation for users/contributors who are new to the platform.

### Out of scope

* Scoping, creating, or managing Operations Documentation; that scope discussion is left for the Docs SIG.
* Scoping and creating new content for any persona state beyond "new"; that is a scope left for the Docs SIG.
* Scoping and creating new content for any advanced user/contributor states; that is a scope left for the Docs SIG.

## Stakeholders

* Contributors, and by extension contributors' organizations
* All user personas
