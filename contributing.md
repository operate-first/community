This is a placeholder file.
In this file will go instructions on how to contribute to this repository.

However, the intention is that this type of one-off file will be replaced by the Community Handbook.

## Items to address

Adhere to style guide (that Community Handbook should be using) to have a separate line for each sentence in a paragraph of MarkDown.
This greatly improves readability of patches/diffs and helps during the pull request review process.
