    See below for meeting details. Anyone can suggest new agenda items for the next
    meeting.

    Sig Operations does not have a single project board to track all on going work
    as the scope is fairly broad.

    However, you may track issues in key repos in the Operate-First github organization.
    These repos are: [apps](https://github.com/operate-first/apps/issues), [operations](https://github.com/operate-first/operations/issues),
    [support](https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues), [common](https://github.com/operate-first/common/issues),
    [opfcli](https://github.com/operate-first/opfcli)
