# SIG Telemetry

Observability has become an increasingly hot topic given the challenges of reliably operating distributed systems such as one finds in Kubernetes environments. The term can cover a lot of ground but a typical definition spans metrics, tracing, and logging. Even if monitoring is often considered to be something distinct, itâ€™s at least closely related. A key part of observability is the automatic collection and transmission of data. In other words, telemetry.

## Scope

We will discuss problem statements, research that group members are performing to address them, and how to evolve the environment to better support research needs.

### In scope

* Define research problem statements around Telemetry
* Discuss solutions to those problem statements
* Provide access to a platform for telemetry research

### Out of scope

* Create Open Data sets for research
* Define a standardized application stack

## Stakeholders

*

### Subproject Creation

Creation of subprojects happens through SIG consensus, coordinated by SIG Chairs.
All subprojects and their memberships are tracked in [sigs.yaml](../sigs.yaml).
