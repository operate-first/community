**Vision or motivation**

// description of Operate First motivation and its impacts on developers, operators, and final product

While open source has made software widely available, it has also exposed another barrier to entry: the ability to operate software in production.
Proprietary services for operations undermine the open source model, so we must now shift our focus to open sourcing operations.

In doing so, developers and operators collaborate to apply the operational considerations of a project right back into that project’s code.
