# Operations Special Interest Group

The goal of this SIG is to enable management and operations for hardware and platform tooling within the Operate First Community Cloud (op1st).
Meeting Agenda docs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEcLGP_sBSNwTLPOo_2Nu6oTqPytOTBt0c0_pVUQJwo/edit). See below for meeting details. Anyone can suggest new agenda items for the next meeting.
Sig Operations does not have a single project board to track all on going work as the scope is fairly broad.
However, you may track issues in key repos in the Operate-First github organization. These repos are: [apps](https://github.com/operate-first/apps/issues), [operations](https://github.com/operate-first/operations/issues), [support](https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues), [common](https://github.com/operate-first/common/issues), [opfcli](https://github.com/operate-first/opfcli)

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Operations Special Interest Group.
